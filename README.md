Abstract
This abstract outlines the development of a functional clock using an Arduino Uno, without the need for an external Real-Time Clock (RTC) module. While convenient, RTC modules add cost and complexity to the project. This project explores achieving reasonable timekeeping accuracy by leveraging the Arduino's internal clock. However, the internal clock's inherent drift can cause time discrepancies over extended periods.
To address this limitation, the project implements a two-pronged approach. First, a method is developed to evaluate the internal clock's drift. This involves comparing the Arduino's millis() function, which tracks milliseconds elapsed since power-up, with a known accurate reference time source. A computer clock synchronized with an internet time server could serve as this reference. By comparing these time values over a period, the project quantifies the drift, expressed as the time difference gained or lost per hour (e.g., +2 seconds per hour).
Secondly, the project implements a drift correction algorithm based on the measured drift. This algorithm takes the quantified drift into account and adjusts the Arduino's internal timekeeping periodically. The adjustment can involve adding or subtracting a calculated time offset (e.g., adding 2 seconds every hour) to compensate for the drift and maintain a closer alignment with the reference time.
Finally, the Arduino code utilizes the adjusted millis() function to track time (hours, minutes, seconds). The code then formats the final time and displays it on an output device like an LCD screen. This project demonstrates a practical approach to building a reasonably accurate clock with an Arduino. It showcases a method to compensate for the internal clock's drift without relying on additional hardware modules, potentially making the project more cost-effective and simpler to build.

CHAPTER 2 Introduction: Accurate Clock with Arduino
 Keeping accurate time is a fundamental human need. In the digital age, readily available devices like smartphones and computers keep us constantly informed of the time. However, there's something inherently satisfying about a dedicated    clock, particularly one you've built yourself. This project explores the creation of a functional clock using an Arduino Uno, a popular single-board microcontroller platform.
The Arduino offers a versatile and accessible platform for building various electronic projects. While the Arduino includes an internal clock, its accuracy suffers from drift over time. This drift can be caused by factors such as fluctuations in voltage and temperature. For applications where precise timekeeping is crucial, relying solely on the Arduino's internal clock wouldn't be ideal.
This project tackles this challenge by presenting a method to build a reasonably accurate clock using an Arduino without resorting to an external Real-Time Clock (RTC) module. RTC modules, while offering high precision, add cost and complexity to the project. This approach aims to achieve a balance between functionality and simplicity.
The following sections will delve deeper into the project's objectives:
Evaluating Internal Clock Drift: Exploring methods to assess the inherent inaccuracy of the Arduino's internal clock.
Drift Correction Algorithm: Developing an algorithm to compensate for the measured drift, maintaining a closer alignment with a reference time source.
Timekeeping and Display: Implementing logic within the Arduino code to track time and display the formatted time on an output device like an LCD screen.
By successfully building this clock, you'll gain valuable experience working with Arduino hardware and software. You'll also learn how to address limitations inherent in electronic components and develop algorithms to achieve desired functionalities.
